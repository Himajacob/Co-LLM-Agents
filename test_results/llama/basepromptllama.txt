Alice: <"Hi Bob, I'm in the bedroom and found a <cupcake> (378). Should we split up or work together to find the remaining goal objects?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <"Hey Alice, since you're already holding a cupcake and I'm in the kitchen with an apple, how about I grab the juice from the fridge while you check out the living room for the coffeetable and pudding?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <Here's a short message to send to Alice:

"Hey Alice! I'm in the kitchen now and found the remaining <pudding> (373). I'll grab it and head back to the living room with the <apple> (374) and <pudding>. Can you finish checking the living room for any other goal objects or put your <cupcake> (378) on the <coffeetable>?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <Given the situation, I'd suggest sending a short message to Bob:

"Hey Bob! Good job finding the pudding. Why don't you grab another cupcake while you're in the kitchen? That way, we can put all the items on the coffeetable at once." 

This message is helpful because it points out that there's still one more cupcake needed and suggests a way to optimize our effort by grabbing both cupcakes simultaneously. It also acknowledges Bob's success in finding the pudding and encourages him to continue making progress.>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <Given your progress and previous actions, here's a short message to send to Bob:

"Hey Bob! Great job finding the pudding. I'm still in the kitchen. Why don't you grab another cupcake while you're here? That way, we can put all the items on the coffeetable at once.">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <"Hey Bob! Great job finding the pudding. I'm still in the living room with nothing to grab here now that you've found it. Why don't you head back to the kitchen and grab the remaining cupcake while you're there? That way, we can put all the items on the coffeetable at once.">

Alice: <Since Bob is in the kitchen and has access to unchecked containers, it would be efficient to ask him to search for the remaining goal objects (cupcakes) in those containers. 

Here's a possible message:
"Hi Bob, I'm in the living room with the coffeetable. Have you found any cupcakes or other goal objects yet? Maybe we can divide the tasks - I'll focus on putting things onto the coffeetable and see if I find anything else, while you search for the cupcakes in the kitchen?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <Since Bob is already in the kitchen and has access to unchecked containers, it's a good idea to ask him to search for the remaining goal objects (cupcakes) in those containers. Here's a possible message:

"Hi Bob, I've got the cupcake in my hand from the kitchen. Can you quickly check the kitchencabinets? Maybe we can find the other cupcakes in one of them?">

Bob: <Given your situation and dialogue history, here's a possible short message to send to Alice:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <Here's a possible short message that you can send to Alice:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <Here's a short message that you can send to Alice:

Alice: <Here's a short message that you can send to Bob:

Bob: <Here is a short message that you (Bob) can send to Alice:

"Hi Alice! I've got nothing in my hands now, but we have the pudding and wine already found - let's focus on finding 2 cupcakes!">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <Here is a short message you can send to Alice:

"Hi Alice! Now that we've got the pudding and wine in hand, let's work together to find 2 more cupcakes. You're still holding nothing, so why don't you check <kitchencabinet> (137), I'll start checking <stove> (157)?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <Based on the progress and previous actions, your current goal is to find 1 wine and 2 cupcakes for the <coffeetable> (247). You're in the kitchen with Bob, where you've already found a cupcake and an unchecked container <stove> (157) is visible. Since you're holding nothing, a suitable message could be:

"Hi Bob! Now that we have the pudding, let's focus on finding the wine and 2 more cupcakes. You can check the <stove> (157), while I'll check the <kitchencabinet> (135). We need to find everything for the goal.">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <Here's a suitable message for you to send to Alice:

Bob: <"Hey Alice, I'm still looking for two more cutleryforks to put in the <dishwasher> (104). Can you check the <kitchencabinet> (75), <kitchencabinet> (77), and <fridge> (103) while I continue holding this one?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <Since you've already checked the livingroom and the bathroom as unexplored areas, it's best to ask Alice to help with the remaining unchecked container in the kitchen that you can't check yourself while holding an object (the microwave). Here's a short message to send:

"Hey Alice, I'm still looking for two more cutleryforks. Can you quickly check the <microwave> (109) and see if you find any? It'd be great if you could help me out!">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <You're in a hurry to finish the housework with Bob together! Given your progress and previous actions, I'll suggest a short message to send to Bob:

"Hey Bob, since you're already holding one cutleryfork, I'll check the <microwave> (109) while you hold onto that one. If there's none in the microwave, we can move on to checking other areas together."

This message is accurate, helpful, and brief, taking into account your current situation and previous actions. It also shows that you're working together with Bob to achieve your shared goal as efficiently as possible.>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <I'll help you adjust the message to make it more accurate and helpful. 

Given that Bob is already holding a cutleryfork (373), and your progress and previous actions, I'll suggest a revised short message to send to Bob:

"Hey Bob, I'm in the livingroom with nothing in my hands. Why don't you bring the held <cutleryfork> (373) over to me so we can put it into the <dishwasher> (104), and then we can work on finding the remaining two cutleryforks together?"

This revised message is accurate, helpful, and brief, taking into account your current situation and previous actions. It also shows that you're working collaboratively with Bob to achieve the goal as soon as possible.>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <Given that you're holding nothing and I've already put one <cutleryfork> (373) into the <dishwasher> (104), here's a short message to send to Alice:

"Hey Alice, why don't you come with me to the kitchen with the <cutleryfork> (376) you're holding? We can work together to find and put the remaining two cutleryforks into the <dishwasher> (104).">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <Since Bob is already in the bedroom with nothing in his hands, your next action would be to give him a task or ask for help. Given that you're holding a <cutleryfork> (374), I'll suggest a revised short message to send to Bob:

"Hey Bob, can you come over here to the livingroom and take this <cutleryfork> (374) from me? Once we both have one cutleryfork, we can work together to find the last one and put all three into the <dishwasher> (104).">

Alice: <"Hey Bob, found the <dishwasher> (159) in the kitchen already. Since you have two <cutleryforks>, why don't you put them in the dishwasher? I'll start checking the kitchencabinets for the remaining cutlery and plate.">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <Here's a short message to send to Bob:

"Hey Bob, how about you put those two <cutleryforks> (385) and (386) in the dishwasher? I'll start checking the kitchencabinets for the remaining cutlery and plate.">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <Here's a short message to send to Bob:

"Put those two <cutleryforks> (385) and (386) in the dishwasher. I'll check the kitchencabinets.">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <Here's a short message to send to Bob:

"Hey Bob, you have two cutleryforks, can you put them in the dishwasher while I check the kitchencabinets?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <Since we've already found and put 2 cutlery forks and 1 plate into the dishwasher, our goal is to find the remaining 1 cutlery fork and 0 plates (since we've already found a plate).

Let's send a message that takes advantage of Bob's current situation: he has two cutleryforks in his hand. Here's a short and helpful message:

"Hey Bob, you have two <cutleryforks> (385) and (386), can you put them in the dishwasher while I check the kitchencabinets?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <Given your current situation, I'd suggest sending this message to Alice:

"Hey Alice, I'm holding two <cutleryforks> (385) and (386). You check the kitchencabinets while I put these in the dishwasher."

This message takes advantage of the fact that you're already holding the necessary objects, making it efficient for both of you to complete your tasks.>

Alice: <Here's a short and helpful message that takes advantage of Bob's current situation:

"Hey Bob, you have two cutleryforks! Can you put them in the dishwasher while I check the kitchencabinets?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <Here's a revised message that takes into account the current situation:

"Hey Alice, you know we need one more cutlery fork. Can you check the kitchencabinets while I put these two in the dishwasher?"

This message is helpful and brief, and it leverages Bob's current advantage of holding the necessary objects to complete a part of the goal.>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <Given your situation and dialogue history, here's a short and helpful message for Alice:

"Hey Alice, I'm in the bathroom with no progress. Want to check the living room while I head back to the kitchen?" 

This message is accurate, as you're currently in the bathroom without finding any goal objects. It's also helpful because it asks Alice to explore an unexplored area that might contain a cutlery fork. Finally, it's brief and takes into account your previous actions and current situation.>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <Given the shared goal of finding and putting 3 cutlery forks and 1 plate into the <dishwasher> (159), considering that we've already found and put <cutleryfork> (385) and <cutleryfork> (386) into the <dishwasher> (159), and I'm holding nothing, here's a short message for Alice:

"Hey Alice, let me take the two cutlery forks to the dishwasher. You check the kitchencabinets while I finish putting them in.">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <Given your shared goal and current situation, here's a short and helpful message for Alice:

"Hey Alice, I'm holding nothing now. Let me go back to the kitchen with you to finish putting these two cutlery forks into the dishwasher."

This message is accurate because you're indicating that you'll be rejoining Alice in the kitchen to complete part of the goal. It's also helpful since it implies that together, you can make progress on completing the remaining subgoal. The message is brief and takes into account your previous actions and current situation.>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <Given your current progress and situation, it would be best to send a message asking Bob if he has finished checking the kitchen cabinets yet, since you've asked him to check them earlier. 

Here's a suggested message:

"Hey Bob, have you checked the kitchen cabinets yet?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <Given your current progress and situation, I would suggest the following response as Bob:

"No, I'm in the bedroom right now checking the <cabinet> (328). Should only take a minute or two."

Bob: <Since Alice is already busy checking the kitchen cabinets and has asked you to check the fridge in your previous dialogue, it would be a good idea to let her know that you're holding the poundcake and suggest she focus on finding the remaining objects while you continue with the rest of the goal.

"Hey Alice, I'm still holding the <poundcake> (372). Since we need to put all 5 items on the <kitchentable> (72), maybe you can try looking for the other goal objects now that I've got this one covered?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <Your message is clear and to the point, suggesting Alice focus on finding the remaining objects while you take care of the poundcake. However, to make it even more accurate and helpful, I'd suggest a slight modification:

"Hey Alice, I'm still holding the <poundcake> (372). Since we need all 5 items on the <kitchentable> (72), maybe you can try looking for the <wine>, <juice>, and <apple> now that I've got this one covered"

"Hey Bob, now that we've got a good system going, why don't I check the kitchencabinets while you explore other areas? Let me know if I find anything!">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <Since you're holding nothing and Alice is free to search the kitchencabinets for the cupcake, you can suggest that she check there while you explore other areas or wait for her results. A suitable message could be:

"Hey Alice! Why don't you start checking the kitchencabinets while I take a look at the remaining unchecked containers and see if we have any luck finding the last apple and cupcake?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <Given your progress and previous actions, and considering Bob's suggestion that you check the kitchencabinets while he explores other areas, I would suggest a short message to send to Bob:

"Found 1 plate. Can you check the <fridge> (165) while I continue checking here?"
 
This message is accurate because it mentions that Bob has found one plate already.

This message is accurate as it mentions that Bob still needs to put one object on the table. It's helpful as it assigns a task to Alice in a complementary area, the fridge, and asks for her assistance with a specific goal-related action. The message is brief and doesn't repeat previous messages.>
