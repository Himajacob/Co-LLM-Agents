Alice: <<think>
Okay, so Alice is trying to help her friend Bob finish their housework together. They both have a shared goal of finding and placing specific items on the coffee table. Right now, Alice is in the kitchen, holding nothing. She's found an apple, which is one of the needed items. 

She also has information about where Bob was last time they saw him—he was in the bedroom, holding nothing. Additionally, she found an unchecked container called "cabinet" (216) in the bedroom. The bathroom hasn't been explored yet.

From the previous actions, Alice went to explore the bedroom, living room, and kitchen. Since their goal is to get pudding, juice, apple, and two cupcakes onto the coffee table, they need to find all these items. 

Alice currently has the apple but needs pudding, juice, and two cupcakes. The message she should send to Bob should be helpful and concise, prompting him to explore areas where they might find the missing items.

Given that Alice is in the kitchen and has found the apple, maybe the next step for her is to check if there's any more needed items nearby or if she needs help with something else. However, since the message is from Alice to Bob, she should probably ask him to explore areas where they can find pudding, juice, and cupcakes.

Looking at their locations: the bedroom has a "cabinet" container that hasn't been checked yet. The bathroom is unexplored, which might have more containers or items. The living room has the coffee table, but she already found it, so maybe Bob should check there for any objects.

But wait, the goal is to find and put these items on the coffee table. So perhaps Alice should ask Bob to help her get pudding from somewhere else, like the fridge or another container. Since she's in the kitchen, maybe she can look for more items there, but she might need to check other areas.

Wait, the fridge (103) is one of the containers that were found in her progress. So maybe the juice is in the fridge. The cupcakes could be elsewhere, perhaps in the cabinet or another container. Since Bob was last seen in the bedroom, which has a "cabinet" container, he might need to check there for more items.

So, Alice should probably ask Bob to explore the bedroom's cabinet for any items they need. Alternatively, she might also need to check other areas like the bathroom or other containers.

In her message, since she already found the apple and knows where the coffee table is, she can tell Bob that she has the apple but needs help with the others. She should prompt him to explore his current location—the bedroom—and perhaps other locations for the missing items.

So, the message could be something like: "I have the apple. Can you check the fridge and the bedroom's cabinet for pudding, juice, and cupcakes?" Or maybe more concise: "I found an apple. Need help finding pudding, juice, and cupcakes. Check the fridge and our containers in the bedroom."

Wait, but the fridge is already noted as a container, so perhaps she can ask Bob to look there for juice and check the bedroom's cabinet for other items.

Putting it all together, Alice should send a message informing Bob about the apple and asking him to help find the remaining items. Since they need pudding, juice, and two cupcakes, and she has the apple, she needs those three more. Juice is likely in the fridge (103), and the cupcakes might be elsewhere.

So her message could be: "I have the apple. Need help finding pudding, juice, and two cupcakes. Check the fridge and our containers in the bedroom." But since Bob was last in the bedroom, he should check there first for any needed items.

Alternatively, she can say: "I found an apple. Need help getting pudding, juice, and cupcakes. Please explore the fridge and bedroom's cabinet."

But perhaps more accurately, since the message should be direct, maybe: "I have the apple. Can you check the fridge for juice and our containers in the bedroom for pudding and cupcakes?" That way, she's covering both possible locations.

But wait, the goal is to put all items onto the coffee table. So maybe after collecting them, they need to bring them there. But the message is about finding, so maybe it's just to find each item first.

So, considering all that, Alice should send a message informing Bob of her progress and asking him to help locate the remaining items in specific areas.

Alice: <<think>
Okay, so Alice is in the bathroom, holding nothing. She's in a hurry to finish their housework with Bob. Their goal is to find and put 1 pudding, 1 juice, 1 apple, and 2 cupcakes onto the coffee table.

From the progress, she found an unchecked container called "cabinet" (216) in the bedroom. Also, Bob was last seen in the bedroom holding nothing. She previously sent a message and checked the fridge and another cabinet without success. Now, she needs to inform Bob about finding an apple and perhaps ask for help with other items.

She should send a short message that's helpful and direct. She found an apple, which is one of the needed items, so mentioning it is good. Since Bob was in the bedroom, maybe he can check there again or other places she hasn't checked yet, like the bathroom where she is now but doesn't have any relevant items.

She might ask him to look for pudding, juice, and cupcakes elsewhere, perhaps in the kitchen or the other containers she found, like the "kitchencabinet" (73). Also, she needs to remind Bob about the coffee table location so he knows where to place the items once found.
</think>

"Hey Bob, I found an apple. Can you check the bedroom for pudding and the kitchen for juice and cupcakes? Don't forget to put everything on the <coffeetable> (268).">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <<think>
Okay, so Alice needs to send a message to Bob about their shared goal of finding specific items for the coffee table. From her last message, she found an apple and is in the bathroom now. She should inform Bob about this progress.

She knows that Bob was in the bedroom holding nothing and found the coffee table and some pudding, juice, and apple there. He's currently holding a cupcake. There are also cabinets in the kitchen he hasn't checked yet.

Alice should ask Bob to check if he can find another cupcake since they need two. Also, she needs him to help place everything on the table once found.

So her message should be concise, stating she found the apple, asking about the second cupcake, and checking if he can put all items on the table.
</think>

Alice: "Bob, I found the apple! Can you check the bedroom for another cupcake? Also, let me know when you can help put everything on the coffee table.">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <

Alice is in a hurry to finish their shared goal with Bob. She needs to communicate her progress effectively.

She should inform Bob about finding the apple and ask him to check specific locations for the remaining items. Since she's now in the bathroom, she might need to suggest he look elsewhere for juice or cupcakes.

Considering his last holding of a cupcake and that they have two needed, perhaps he can search more while she checks other areas.

She should keep her message clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary information.
</think>

Alice: "Bob, I found the apple! Can you check the fridge for juice and see if there are more cupcakes in the kitchen?">

Bob: <<think>
Okay, so I need to help Bob figure out what message he should send to Alice to get their housework done faster. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the goal is to find and put 1 wine, 2 cupcakes, and 1 pudding onto the <coffeetable> (247). Right now, Bob isn't holding anything and is in the bedroom where he hasn't found anything yet. Alice's location isn't known, but she might be elsewhere since she hasn't checked other areas.

Bob's previous actions were going into the bedroom and checking the cabinet. Since he found nothing there, maybe he should explore new areas next. The kitchen and bathroom are unexplored, so perhaps those are good places to look next.

Looking at the objects needed: wine is probably in the kitchen, cupcakes might also be in the kitchen or a baking area, and pudding could be in the fridge or another place. Since Bob checked the cabinet but found nothing, maybe he should go back there again or check somewhere else.

Wait, no—Bob's message needs to prompt Alice to help find these items. So, he should ask Alice where specific objects are located or if she has found any of them.

He can't hold two objects at once, so he might need to make multiple trips. But the note says there are no costs for holding, so maybe that's not a concern.

Bob is in the bedroom and hasn't found anything. He should probably let Alice know his current situation and ask if she's found any of the goal items or if she can help explore other areas.

So, the message needs to be helpful, accurate, and brief. It shouldn't repeat information. Given that Bob checked the cabinet but didn't find anything, maybe he should suggest checking the kitchen next or ask Alice about her progress with the objects.

Putting it all together, the message should inform Alice where Bob is (bedroom), what he's found so far (nothing), and perhaps ask if she has found any goal items. Also, offer to help explore other areas if needed.
</think>

"Hey Alice, I'm in the bedroom and haven't found anything yet. Do you know where the wine, cupcakes, or pudding are? Let me know if you've found any of them or need help exploring elsewhere!">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <<think>
Okay, so Bob needs to send a message to Alice to help them finish their tasks as quickly as possible. Let me see what's going on.

From the information given, the goal is to get 1 wine, 2 cupcakes, and 1 pudding onto the <coffeetable>. So far, Bob has already put the wine there. He's holding a cupcake now (either 380 or 381) and found another cupcake and pudding in the kitchen. Alice is also in the kitchen holding pudding (id 385). They need two cupcakes, so they have one more to get.

Bob hasn't checked the bedroom yet, which might be where another cupcake could be. So maybe he should suggest checking the bedroom for another cupcake or ask Alice if she can help.

Wait, but Bob is in the kitchen and has a cupcake. He's holding it, so he can drop it somewhere? Or does he need to put it down to pick up another object? The instructions say he can hold two objects at a time, but since he's already holding one, maybe he needs to put it down before picking up more.

But the main point is they need that second cupcake. So Bob should probably suggest checking the bedroom for it or ask Alice if she knows where it is.

Also, they might need to move things around. Maybe Alice can help him get the second cupcake from wherever it is. Or perhaps he needs to check the fridge again, but that's already been done.

So in his message, Bob should probably let Alice know what's needed next. Since he's holding a cupcake and found another one, maybe he can ask if Alice has seen any more cupcakes or where the pudding is, as she might be holding it.

Wait, but Alice is already holding pudding (id 385). So they have that. They need two cupcakes: Bob has one (380) and needs to find the second one, possibly in the bedroom.

So his message should inform Alice about the remaining items needed and ask if she can help locate or retrieve them.

Putting it all together, Bob should say something like:

"Hey Alice, I'm holding a cupcake. We need one more. Let me check the bedroom for another while you check if there's anything else we need."

That way, they can both work on their tasks simultaneously.
</think>

"Hey Alice, I'm in the bedroom now checking for any goal objects. I'm still holding a cupcake (380). Can you help me find the second one and let me know where the pudding is?">

=== END OF EPISODE 5 ===

Bob: <<think>
Alright, so Bob is trying to help finish their housework with Alice. Their goal is to find and put three cutlery forks into the dishwasher. Let me break this down.

First, where are they? Bob is in the bedroom holding nothing. He's found an unchecked container called the cabinet (216). So that's something he can use, maybe to store or organize things later.

Next, what has happened so far? They both have been communicating about finding goal objects and asking for help when needed. It seems like they're working together remotely, coordinating their searches without knowing each other's exact locations yet.

So Bob is in the bedroom with a cabinet container he hasn't checked yet. He needs to check it, right? Because maybe inside that cabinet are some cutlery forks or other tools needed for their goal.

Bob should probably let Alice know where he is and what he's found so she can update her progress. Also, since he's in the bedroom and hasn't explored elsewhere, perhaps he can offer to look around more if needed.

He shouldn't ask for help unless he finds something, as per their agreement. So his message needs to be concise: tell Alice where he is, what he's found (the cabinet), and maybe offer to check other areas if she needs it.

I should make sure the message is clear and not too lengthy. Maybe start with a greeting, state his location, mention the cabinet, and offer assistance if needed.
</think>

"Hey Alice, I'm in the bedroom with an unchecked container called <cabinet> (216). I'll check it now to see if there's anything useful. Let me know if you need me to explore elsewhere.">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <<think>
Okay, so I'm Alice trying to help Bob find and put three cutlery forks into the dishwasher. Let me see what we know.

I'm in the bathroom with nothing. Bob is in the bedroom holding nothing as well. He found a <cabinet> (216), which might be useful for storing or organizing items later on.

Our goal is to get those three cutlery forks into the dishwasher, so that's the main focus. Since we're both exploring separately, it's important to keep each other updated and offer help when needed.

In this case, Bob hasn't found any of the cutlery yet, but he's in a new room (bedroom) where he might find more items. He needs to check the bedroom for possible cutlery or containers that can hold them once found.

So, I should tell him to look around the bedroom and let me know if he finds anything useful. That way, we can coordinate better on getting all three forks into the dishwasher.

I also remember that there's a <bathroomcabinet> (190) that Alice checked earlier, but it didn't yield anything. Bob should focus on his current location first before moving elsewhere.

So the message should be encouraging and helpful, asking him to explore his room and share any findings. Keeping it concise is key since they're in a hurry.

Alice: <<think>
Okay, so Alice needs to figure out how to help her and Bob finish their housework by finding and putting certain items into the dishwasher. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the goal. They need to find 3 cutlery forks and 1 plate and put them into the dishwasher (id 159). Right now, Alice is in the living room and hasn't found anything yet. The kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom are all unexplored areas she can check next.

From their previous actions, Alice went to explore the living room using [goexplore] <livingroom> (198), but that didn't yield any goal objects. Bob is presumably somewhere else since Alice doesn't know where he is, so communication will be key here.

Alice needs to inform Bob about her current status and ask for help in exploring other areas. She should probably suggest checking the kitchen next because that's a likely place where the cutlery forks and plate might be found. Since they can hold two objects at a time each, maybe assigning specific tasks could help—like one searching the kitchen while the other checks another area.

In her message to Bob, she needs to be concise but informative. She should mention what she's doing now, where else they should look, and perhaps ask for updates on his progress or where he is. This way, they can coordinate their efforts effectively without repeating information unnecessarily.
</think>

"Hey Bob, I’m in the living room but haven’t found anything yet. Let’s check the kitchen next—maybe you can search there while I explore other areas. Update me on your progress and let me know if you’re in a different spot!">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <<think>
Alright, let me figure out what Alice needs to do next.

Alice is in the living room and hasn't explored the kitchen yet. The goal items are three cutlery forks and a plate. From her current location, she can go explore the kitchen because that's where the goal objects might be found. Bob isn't holding anything, so maybe he can help look elsewhere or bring some items over.

She should probably send a message asking Bob to check specific areas in the kitchen, like the kitchencabinets and the fridge. Maybe also mention looking under the stove since those spots could have the cutlery forks. If Bob finds any of the items, he can hand them over, and Alice can hold two at a time.

She wants to keep it brief, so the message should be straightforward: ask Bob to check the kitchen areas for the needed items and let him know she'll look there too.
</think>

"Bob, I'm going to explore the kitchen. Can you check the kitchencabinets and fridge for cutlery forks? Also, check under the stove in case any are hidden there. Let me know if you find anything, and I'll head over to help once I'm done checking the areas.">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <<think>
Okay, so Alice is in the living room and hasn't explored the kitchen yet. The goal is to find three cutlery forks and a plate. Bob is already in the kitchen holding a cutlery fork and found another one there. So, she should probably check if he can use that.

Alice might ask Bob to look for more cutlery forks in the kitchencabinets since those areas are still unchecked. Also, she needs to find the plate. Maybe Bob can help her search the bedroom or other areas for it.

She should make her request clear and helpful, asking Bob to check specific spots while she continues exploring where she can.
</think>

"Bob, I'm in the living room. Can you help me check the kitchencabinets (134, 135, 137, 138) and the fridge (165, 166) for more cutlery forks? Also, could you look in the bedroom again for the plate (388)? I'll explore where I can while waiting for your updates.">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <

Okay, let's see what Alice needs to do next.

She is in the living room and hasn't explored the kitchen yet. The goal items are three cutlery forks and a plate. Bob is already in the kitchen holding one cutlery fork (id 385) and found another nearby. He also found an unchecked plate in the bedroom, so he can grab that.

Alice needs to help Bob collect the remaining two cutlery forks from the kitchencabinets. She should probably ask him to check those areas since they are still unexplored.

So, a possible message could be: "Bob, can you check the kitchencabinets for more cutlery forks? I'll explore the kitchen and bedroom."

But maybe she should make it shorter or more concise. Alternatively, she might suggest that Bob continues checking while she explores other areas where the plate could be.

Wait, the plate was found in the bedroom already, but Bob found it. So maybe Alice can go to the bedroom to help him with the plate.

Hmm, perhaps the message is: "Bob, I'm going to check the kitchencabinets for more cutlery forks. Do you need help with anything else?"

That sounds helpful and asks if Bob needs assistance elsewhere.
</think>

"Bob, I'll explore the kitchen and check the kitchencabinets for more cutlery forks while you continue. Let me know if you need help with the plate.">

Alice needs to help Bob collect the remaining two cutlery forks from the kitchencabinets. She should probably ask him to check those areas since they are still unexplored.

So, Alice will send a message asking Bob to explore the kitchen's kitchencabinets for more cutlery forks and then bring everything to the dishwasher.

Alice: <<think>
Okay, so I need to help Alice figure out what to message Bob about their housework together. Let's see the situation.

First, their goal is to find and put 1 wine, 1 pancake, 1 poundcake, 1 juice, and 1 apple onto the kitchen table (id 130). 

Alice's current progress: she's in the bathroom and holding nothing. She found an unchecked container called Bathroom Cabinet (25), but I'm not sure what that means yet. Bob is possibly elsewhere because Alice doesn't know where he is. The other areas like living room, kitchen, and bedroom are unexplored.

Previous actions include going explore to the bathroom, which was action [goexplore] <bathroom> (11). Their dialogue history is minimal; both have set up that they'll notify each other about goal objects and ask for help when needed.

So, Alice needs to inform Bob about her findings. Since she's in the bathroom and found a container, maybe it has something to do with their goal items. She's holding nothing, so she might need Bob's help to get certain items from other areas.

Given that the kitchen is unexplored, perhaps Bob can check there for pancake, poundcake, juice, or wine. The Bathroom Cabinet could contain an apple, but since it's unchecked, maybe it doesn't have anything yet. Or maybe it does, and she needs Bob to confirm.

Wait, the message should be helpful and brief. So Alice should tell Bob where she is and what she found, asking him to check areas he can access to find specific items.

She might say something like: "Hey Bob, I'm in the bathroom and found a container. Let me know if you can check the kitchen or other areas for goal objects."

But perhaps more precise: she's in the bathroom, maybe looking for apple there, but since she didn't find it yet, she might need him to look elsewhere.

Alternatively, since she's near the bathroom and Bob is possibly in another area, she should ask him if he can check the kitchen for specific items.

Putting this together, a possible message: "Bob, I'm in the bathroom. Let me know what you can find in the kitchen or other areas. Need pancake, juice, wine, apple on the table."

That seems accurate and helpful without being repetitive.
</think>

"Bob, I'm in the bathroom. Could you check the kitchen for pancake, juice, wine, and an apple? Let me know if you find anything!">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <<think>
Okay, so I need to help figure out what Alice should message Bob next in their housework task.

Let me recap the situation. The goal is to find and place five items: wine, pancake, poundcake, juice, apple on the kitchen table. 

Currently, Alice is in the bathroom and has found nothing except a Bathroom Cabinet (25) which hasn't been checked yet. Bob is holding an apple but is in the living room, so he can't reach the kitchen or bathroom easily.

So, since Alice is in the bathroom and has a container there that's unchecked, she should check what's inside. Maybe it'll have juice or another item. If not, she might need to explore elsewhere.

Bob is holding an apple, so perhaps he should start looking for other items while Alice does her part. But Bob can only carry two objects at once and currently has the apple.

I think Alice should suggest checking the bathroom cabinet because it's unexplored and could have something useful. She might also ask Bob to check somewhere else if needed, but since Bob is in the living room, maybe the fridge or another location.

So her message should be concise, asking about the bathroom cabinet and perhaps where Bob can look next.
</think>

"Hey Bob, I'm checking the Bathroom Cabinet (25) now. Do you know a good place to find juice? Also, any other spots we should cover?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <<think>
Okay, so Alice is in the bathroom, looking around but hasn't found any of the goal items yet. She knows that Bob is holding an apple in the living room. The bathroom has a Bathroom Cabinet (25) that's unchecked, and she needs to check it. 

She should probably tell Bob that she's checking the Bathroom Cabinet next and see if he can help with anything else or if he has found any of the items.

So, a possible message would be: "Hey Bob, I'm checking the bathroom cabinet now. Any progress from you? Is there something specific I should look for?"

This way, she updates him on her actions and asks for his input or progress.
</think>

"Hey Bob, I'm heading to check the Bathroom Cabinet. Any particular items there I should look out for?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <<think>
Okay, so Alice is in the bathroom, checking the Bathroom Cabinet (25) because she found it earlier and hasn't opened it yet. She needs to let Bob know what she's doing next.

She should probably ask for Bob's help if he finds any of the items or if there's something he can do from his current location.

So, a message like: "Bob, I'm checking the Bathroom Cabinet now. Do you have time to check anywhere else while you're in the living room?"

That way, she's informing him of her action and asking for his help if possible.
</think>

"Bob, I'm checking the Bathroom Cabinet now. Do you have time to check anywhere else while you're in the living room?">

Alice: <<think>
Alright, let me break down how to approach this situation. Alice is in the bathroom and needs to check the Bathroom Cabinet (25). She should inform Bob about her action so he can assist if needed.

She's also looking for the wine in the bedroom, which hasn't been checked yet. By asking Bob to check the bedroom while he's in the living room, they can coordinate their searches more effectively.

The message should be clear and concise, allowing both of them to know each other's next steps without unnecessary details.

"Bob, I'm checking the Bathroom Cabinet now. Can you check the bedroom for wine while you're in the living room?">

=== END OF EPISODE 20 ===

Alice: <<think>
Okay, so Alice needs to find and put 1 wine, 1 juice, 1 apple, 1 cupcake, and 1 poundcake onto the kitchen table. Let me see where each of these items are located based on her progress.

She's in the kitchen already, holding nothing. She found the kitchen table (72), along with a cupcake (368) and a poundcake (372). That's two out of five items done right there. 

In the living room, she found wine (373). Wait, but the note says she found wine (380) in the livingroom. Hmm, maybe that's an error. Oh well, regardless, she has one wine somewhere.

Then in the bedroom, she found a cupcake (378) and juice (379). So she already has two cupcakes and the juice, which are both needed. Wait, but she needs just one cupcake and one poundcake. She has a cupcake, but not the poundcake yet.

She also noted that there are multiple kitchencabinets (73-78), a dishwasher (104), and a microwave (109) in the kitchen, all unchecked. So those containers could hold objects she needs.

Her previous actions included going to the bedroom, checking cabinets, exploring the kitchen, living room, etc.

So, her current holdings: nothing. She's in the kitchen with the table, cupcake, poundcake nearby, and sees Bob holding nothing.

She needs juice (found in bedroom) and wine (livingroom). The apple is unexplored. So maybe she should check the bathroom next since it's unexplored. Or perhaps check the fridge if it's a container.

Wait, in her progress, she saw that containers include the kitchencabinets and the fridge (103), but the fridge wasn't checked yet. So maybe she needs to check the fridge for juice, which is already found? Or is the fridge where she might find something else?

Also, the bathroom hasn't been explored, so perhaps there's an apple there or another location.

So, thinking step-by-step:

1. She has cupcake and poundcake in the kitchen. So she needs wine (livingroom), juice (bedroom), and apple (bathroom?).

2. Since Bob is with her, maybe he can check other areas. Like, send him to the living room for wine, bedroom for juice, and bathroom for apple.

3. She can then pick up the items once they are retrieved.

So in the message, she needs to ask Bob to go get those missing items: wine, juice, and apple.

She should structure her request clearly.
</think>

"Hey Bob, I found the cupcake and poundcake on the kitchen table. Can you grab the wine from the living room and check the bathroom for the apple? Also, I need the juice, which is in the bedroom.">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <<think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help Bob send a message to Alice about their housework. The goal is to find and put specific items on the kitchen table. Let me break down what each has found.

First, Bob is in the living room with nothing. He saw Alice holding <wine> (380) there. He also found the kitchen table, cupcake, and poundcake, which are key items they need. The apple and juice are still missing.

He checked various places: bathroom, bedroom, livingroom, and the kitchen areas like the kitchencabinet and microwave. In the bedroom, he found a cupcake and juice. So, that's another item.

So, Bob needs to tell Alice which items he has so she knows where to look next. He should mention the items he's already found and ask about the missing ones—apple and juice. Maybe suggest checking the fridge or somewhere specific for the apple and juice since they were found in different locations before. 

Also, note that Bob can hold two objects at a time, but it doesn't seem like that affects their current task. The main thing is to coordinate finding the remaining items.

Putting this together, Bob should inform Alice of his findings and ask about what's missing. That way, they can work together more efficiently.
</think>

"Hey Alice, I found the <cupcake> (368) and <poundcake> (372) on the <kitchentable> (72). I also saw the <wine> (373) in the livingroom where you were holding <wine> (380). Can you check if you have the <apple> anywhere? Also, there was a <juice> in the bedroom. Do you know where that is?">

Alice: <<think>
Okay, so I need to help Alice figure out what to send to Bob. Let's see... They're working together on housework and their goal is to find certain items for the fridge. The current progress is that Alice is in the kitchen, holding nothing. She found some things like the fridge, juice, pudding, apples, and she sees some cabinets and other areas. Bob is also there, not holding anything yet.

From the previous actions, Alice has been exploring and checking various places like the bathroom and kitchen. She's checked several kitchen cabinets and the stove. The goal is to get a cupcake, pudding, two apples, and juice into the fridge.

So, looking at what she's found: she has pudding (383), which is one of the required items. She also saw juice in the fridge, so that might already be there. But wait, she can hold two objects, so maybe she needs to pick up more things.

She needs a cupcake and another apple. So her message should probably ask Bob to check areas where these might be found. Since they haven't checked the living room or bedroom yet, those are still unexplored. The bathroom is done.

So maybe Alice can tell Bob that she's holding nothing but has pudding, juice, and apples, but she needs a cupcake. She could suggest checking the livingroom or bedroom for it. Alternatively, she might need to check other areas like the dining room or pantry if those exist.

Wait, in the initial progress, the kitchen is explored, so maybe there are still more places within the kitchen. But according to her previous actions, she's checked the stove and various cabinets. So perhaps the cupcake is elsewhere, like a baking area or another room.

So the message should probably inform Bob that she has pudding and juice but needs a cupcake, and maybe an additional apple. She can ask Bob to help check other areas where these might be found.
</think>

"Hey Bob, I'm holding nothing right now. I've found pudding and juice, but I need a cupcake and another apple. Can you help me check the livingroom or bedroom for those items?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <<think>
Okay, so let me try to figure out what message Alice should send to Bob. They need to get all the items into the fridge as quickly as possible. The goal is to have 1 cupcake, 1 pudding, 2 apples, and 1 juice in the fridge.

From the progress, Alice has already put pudding, an apple (specifically 384 or 385), and juice into the fridge. She's holding nothing right now. Bob is in the kitchen, holding a cupcake. So that means Bob has one of the needed items already.

Alice needs to get two apples into the fridge, but she only found one so far. Also, they need to put the cupcake and possibly another apple into the fridge. Since Alice is in the kitchen where Bob also is, maybe she can ask Bob for help with getting the second apple or checking if he can add it to the fridge.

She could say something like, "Bob, I have pudding, juice, and an apple in the fridge. You have a cupcake. Can you grab another apple from somewhere?" That way, they can combine their findings to meet the goal quickly.
</think>

"Bob, I've got pudding, juice, and one apple in the fridge already. You have a cupcake. Could you grab another apple? Let's get everything done fast!">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify Goal Objects:**
   - Need 1 cupcake.
   - Already have pudding, one apple, and juice in the fridge.

2. **Current Holdings:**
   - Alice is holding nothing new; she last held an apple (but not sure if it's already in fridge).
   - Bob is holding a cupcake, which is one of the needed items.

3. **Task Breakdown:**
   - Convey to Bob that they need the juice.
   - Suggest checking areas where juice might be found next.

**Message:**

"Bob, I'm holding nothing new. You have the cupcake. Let's check the kitchen for juice and see if we can get it in the fridge!"

This message is clear, concise, and directs both towards finding what's missing while utilizing their current holdings efficiently.
</think>

Alice: "Bob, I'm not holding anything new right now. You've got the cupcake. Let's look around the kitchen to find the juice next!">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <<think>
Alright, let's break this down. Alice needs to help Bob get all the required items into the fridge. She already has pudding, one apple, and juice in there. The only missing item is another apple because she can hold two objects at a time, but she might not be holding it anymore.

Bob is holding a cupcake, which means he's halfway there. So Alice needs to let him know what's missing. Since she was previously holding an apple, maybe she should tell Bob that and encourage him to check the kitchen or other areas for more apples or juice.

She should also keep it concise because she's in a hurry. Maybe something like, "Bob, I'm holding nothing now. We need the juice in the fridge. Can you grab it while I check for another apple?"

Wait, but from her progress, she already has pudding, one apple, and juice in the fridge. So she might not be holding anything right now. She needs to let Bob know that only one more apple is needed and maybe suggest checking somewhere else.

She should also mention that they need to put everything into the fridge asap. Maybe: "Bob, I'm not holding anything now. We still need an apple in the fridge. Can you grab another one while I check for juice?"

Hmm, but she already has the juice in. Wait, maybe juice is done? Or does it mean that it's in the fridge but needs to be confirmed.

I think the key points are:
- Ask Bob if he can put the cupcake into the fridge.
- Check with him about the missing apple or juice.
- Keep it brief and action-oriented.

So combining these, maybe: "Bob, I'm holding nothing. We need to put the cupcake in the fridge. Can you grab the last apple while I check for anything else?"

Wait, but she already has pudding, an apple, and juice in. So perhaps she needs one more apple. But the initial message mentioned that she's holding an apple (385), so maybe it's not yet in the fridge.

So, finalizing: "Bob, I'm not holding anything now. We need to put the cupcake and another apple into the fridge. Can you grab them while I check?"

That seems efficient.
</think>

"Bob, I'm not holding anything now. We still need to put the cupcake and another apple into the fridge. Can you grab them while I check?">

Alice: <<think>
Okay, so I need to help Alice send a message to Bob about their housework. Their goal is to find and put certain items into the fridge. Let me break down what's given.

First, the goal objects are 1 poundcake, 2 cupcakes, 1 wine, and 1 apple, all needing to go into the fridge (103). Alice is in the kitchen holding nothing. She found the fridge, some cupcakes (368 and 375), an apple (377), and various containers like kitchencabinets and a cabinet. Bob is also in the kitchen without anything.

Looking at their progress: Alice already has two cupcakes and an apple. So she needs one more cupcake and the poundcake and wine. The fridge is found, so that's a step done. 

Previous actions include exploring the kitchen, checking some kitchencabinets, exploring bedroom and living room. Alice found an apple in the living room and a cabinet in the bedroom. The bathroom is unexplored.

Dialogue history shows both are keeping each other updated. So their last messages were just acknowledgments of this system. 

Now, the task is to generate a message from Alice to Bob that's helpful and brief. She needs to inform Bob about her progress, ask for help finding the missing items, and suggest ways they can work together.

She should mention what she has so far (cupcakes and apple) and what’s still needed (poundcake and wine). Since she's in the kitchen with Bob, maybe she can ask him to check the living room for the poundcake or another area for the wine. Alternatively, since she found an unchecked container in the bedroom, perhaps that's where the wine is.

Wait, let me think: Alice found an apple in the livingroom and a cabinet in the bedroom. So the bedroom has a container (cabinet 216) but no items yet. The bathroom is unexplored, so maybe the wine is there? Or perhaps the poundcake could be elsewhere.

Hmm, since she already has two cupcakes, one more is needed. One cupcake was found at 368 in the kitchen, and another at 375 in the livingroom. So maybe she needs to check the living room for the last cupcake or other areas.

Wait, no: she's already holding nothing. She found a cupcake (368) in the kitchen, another in the livingroom (375). But she needs two cupcakes, so perhaps she missed one? Or does she need to get more?

Wait, the goal is 2 cupcakes, and she has two? Wait no, because the initial problem says "find and put 1 poundcake, 2 cupcakes, 1 wine, 1 apple into fridge." So Alice found an apple, which is in the livingroom. She also found a cupcake (368) in the kitchen and another (375) in the livingroom. Wait, does that mean she has two cupcakes? Or maybe only one so far.

Wait, no: she's holding nothing. The progress says she found 2 cupcakes (368 and 375), an apple, and various containers. So she already has two cupcakes, but wait: is it two total or just one? Let me check the problem statement again.

Progress: I'm holding nothing. I'm in the kitchen, where I found fridge (103), cupcake (368), and unchecked containers... Also, I found cupcake (375) and apple (377) in the livingroom. So she has two cupcakes already? Or maybe she's only found one so far.

Wait, no: the way it's written is that in the kitchen, she found <cupcake> (368), and in the livingroom, <cupcake> (375). So total of two cupcakes. But the goal is 2 cupcakes, so she has both. Then she needs to find the poundcake and wine.

Wait no: wait, the problem says "find and put 1 poundcake, 2 cupcakes, 1 wine, 1 apple into fridge." So the cupcake part is 2, which she's found: one in kitchen, one in livingroom. So she needs to find poundcake and wine.

So her message should inform Bob that she has two cupcakes and an apple, and needs help finding the poundcake and wine.

Since they're both in the kitchen now, maybe Bob can check other areas for those items. The fridge is already found, so putting them in would be next steps once found.

Also, note that Alice is holding nothing, so she's free to go wherever. She might need to check other rooms or containers.

So the message should be something like: "Hey Bob, I've found two cupcakes and an apple. Need help finding a poundcake and wine. Let me know if you find them!"

That seems concise and covers what's needed without being too lengthy.
</think>

"Hey Bob, I have two cupcakes and an apple. Can you help me find the poundcake and wine? Let me know if you spot them!">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <<think>
Okay, so Alice is in the kitchen with Bob, and she needs to get specific items into the fridge. Let me figure out what each person can do.

First, the fridge is already there (103), so that's a good start. The required items are 1 poundcake, 2 cupcakes, 1 wine, and 1 apple. From Alice's progress, she found two cupcakes: <cupcake> (368) and <cupcake> (375). She also found an apple (377).

So, she needs to find the remaining things: a poundcake and another cupcake (though she has one already, but maybe she needs two more? Wait, no, she already has two, so she just needs to get them into the fridge. Wait, no, the goal says 2 cupcakes, so she has one more to find or she can use what's there.

Wait, looking back: Progress shows she found <cupcake> (368) and <cupcake> (375). So maybe both are different instances? Or is it a typo in numbering. Anyway, she needs two cupcakes into the fridge. She already has some, but perhaps she needs to check if they're already there or need to be moved.

She also found an apple, which needs to go into the fridge. The wine is still missing, so she needs to find that.

Bob is with her in the kitchen, holding nothing. He can help by checking containers or other areas. Containers mentioned are various kitchencabinets and a cabinet in different locations like bedroom, living room, etc.

So, Alice's message should be about what she has found and what still needs to be done. Since Bob is there, perhaps he can check the kitchen for anything else while she can handle other parts.

I think Alice needs to inform Bob of her progress and ask him to help find the missing items. She might suggest splitting up tasks: her checking other areas like the bathroom or him checking containers in the kitchen while she keeps an eye on the fridge.

She found the apple in the living room, so maybe she can ask Bob to check there again or perhaps see if he can find more items elsewhere.

Also, considering the previous actions, they've been exploring and checking cabinets. So maybe she should let Bob know about the containers and suggest checking them for any missing items.

I should make sure the message is clear and concise, stating what's already found, what needs to be done next, and asking for help with specific tasks.
</think>

"Bob, I'm in the kitchen where we are. I have found two cupcakes (368 and 375) and an apple (377). The fridge (103) is here. We still need a poundcake and another cupcake, plus the wine. Can you check the containers or other areas for these items? Also, the bathroom is unexplored—should I check there?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <

Alright, so Alice is in the bedroom holding nothing but has found <wine> (373) and <apple> (374). Bob is also there holding <poundcake> (372) and <apple> (377). So, it looks like they're both in the bedroom now.

Wait, but in her progress, she said she's in the bedroom, where she found wine and an apple. She also mentioned that Bob is in the bedroom holding a poundcake and an apple. Plus, she found a cupcake in the living room and the fridge with some cupcakes and apples. Hmm.

I need to figure out what's missing: one more cupcake because she already has two? No, wait, goal is 2 cupcakes, so maybe she needs only one more. Wait no, she found two: 368 and 375. So that's good.

She also has the apple, but Bob is holding another apple (377). Maybe they have duplicates, but perhaps each container counts as a separate item? Or maybe it's just multiple instances. The goal specifies to put in one of each type.

So, she needs the poundcake and possibly the wine. Wait, did she find the wine? She found <wine> (373) in the bedroom. So that's done. Then she has apples, cupcakes, and the fridge is there.

Wait, but Bob is holding the poundcake and another apple, so maybe he can help move things around.

So, Alice should probably let Bob know that she needs him to put the poundcake into the fridge, since she's already found two cupcakes, an apple, wine, and has access to the fridge. Maybe Bob can help carry items over.

But in her message, she might want to ask Bob for assistance with getting the remaining items into the fridge, especially the poundcake. So she could say something like, "Hey Bob, I have some goal items: 1 poundcake, 2 cupcakes, 1 wine, and 1 apple. I already found two cupcakes and an apple, but need your help to get the poundcake and put everything into the fridge. Can you help me with that?"

But she should make it concise, as per instructions.

Maybe: "Hey Bob, I have most of the items. Need help getting the poundcake into the fridge. Can you assist?"

Wait, but maybe more precise. Since Bob is holding the poundcake and another apple, perhaps he can place it in the fridge while Alice handles other things.

So, her message should ask Bob to put the poundcake into the fridge as soon as possible.
</think>

"Hey Bob, I have most of the goal items. The only missing one is the poundcake you're holding. Can you put that into the fridge now?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <

Okay, so let me go through this again to make sure I get it right.

Alice is in the kitchen with Bob. She's holding nothing, but she found two cupcakes and an apple in various rooms. The fridge is already there with some cupcakes and apples. Now, they need to find a poundcake and another cupcake for the fridge.

Bob is in the bedroom with Alice, holding the poundcake and an apple. So, Bob can probably bring the poundcake to the kitchen or directly to the fridge.

Alice needs to get that second cupcake from the living room where she found one already. She might need to check other places like the dishw
Okay, so let me think about what each person's status is and how they can contribute.

Alice: In the bedroom with Bob, holding nothing. Found <cupcake> (375) in the livingroom, <apple> (374) and wine (373) elsewhere. Needs to find a poundcake and another cupcake.

Bob: In the bedroom with Alice, holding <poundcake> (372) and <apple> (377). So Bob has the poundcake but not the second cupcake.

So, Alice needs to get the second cupcake from wherever it is. She found one in the livingroom (375), so she might need to check other spots like the dishw
Okay, maybe I should outline the steps they can take together to finish this goal.

1. Bob has the poundcake; he can bring that to the fridge.
2. Alice needs to find the second cupcake. She found one in the livingroom (375), so she might need to check other spots like the dishw
3. Once both cupcakes are in the fridge, along with the poundcake and apple, they'll be done.

So, the message should ask Bob to bring the poundcake to the fridge or maybe to help her find the second cupcake.

I think the best approach is to have Alice inform Bob about what's missing and ask for his help. Since Bob has the poundcake, he can take it to the fridge directly.
</think>

"Bob, I found the apple and two cupcakes already in the fridge, but we're still missing a poundcake and one more cupcake. Can you bring the poundcake to the fridge while I grab the other cupcake?">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <<think>
Okay, so Alice is trying to get all the items into the fridge as soon as possible with Bob's help. She's already found two cupcakes and an apple. The fridge has some of those, but it needs a poundcake and another cupcake.

Bob is holding the poundcake, which he can put into the fridge. He should do that first because it's needed for the goal.

Then, Alice still needs to find another cupcake, maybe from the kitchen or somewhere else, and put it in the fridge as well.

So, Alice should message Bob to encourage him to put the poundcake in the fridge now. Then she'll work on finding the remaining cupcake.

I think that's a good plan.
</think>

"Bob, I have two cupcakes and an apple in the fridge already. You're holding the poundcake—can you put that in the fridge first? Let me grab another cupcake while you do that.">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <<think>
Okay, so Alice is in the bedroom with Bob, holding nothing but has already found a wine and an apple. The fridge is in the kitchen, already containing some cupcakes and apples. The goal is to get 1 poundcake and 2 cupcakes into the fridge.

From the progress, Alice has put <poundcake> (372), <cupcake> (375), <wine> (373), and <apple> (377) into the fridge. Bob is holding nothing but was in the kitchen and found the fridge, so he might need to coordinate with Alice about where to find the missing items.

Wait, actually, in the initial message from Alice, she says they've already found and put all those items into the fridge. So maybe the progress is that everything is done? But then why are they still in the bedroom?

Hmm, perhaps there's a mix-up here. Let me clarify:

Alice mentioned that they've already found and put <poundcake>, two cupcakes, wine, and an apple into the fridge. She's holding nothing, but Bob is in the kitchen where he found the fridge. Alice also saw Bob holding the poundcake and apple.

So, maybe the confusion is whether all items are already in the fridge or if more are needed. The goal states they need to find and put 1 poundcake, 2 cupcakes, 1 wine, and 1 apple into the fridge, which seems like it's done according to Alice's progress. But Bob is holding the poundcake, so maybe he needs to bring it to the fridge.

Alice might be suggesting that they need to get the remaining items, but from her message, everything is already in place except possibly needing Bob to put the items where they belong.

So, perhaps the message should prompt Bob to put the items into the fridge or let Alice know what's needed next.

But wait, since the goal seems completed according to progress, maybe the next step is just to confirm that all items are in place. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding, and some items are still missing.

I think I need to make sure the message is clear about what's done and what's left.

Alternatively, if everything is done, then the message could be more of a confirmation, but given the previous actions, it's possible that Alice wants to ensure Bob helps with the remaining steps or checks for something else.
</think>

Alice: "Bob, I've found the wine and an apple. You have the poundcake; let's put everything in the fridge!">

=== END OF EPISODE 32 ===

Alice: <<think>
Okay, so I need to help Alice by generating a message she can send to Bob. Their goal is to finish the housework together, and right now, Alice is in the kitchen holding nothing. She found the kitchen table, a cutlery fork, and some unchecked containers like various kitchencabinets and appliances like the dishwasher, stove, microwave. Bob is also here but isn't holding anything.

From the previous actions, it looks like Alice has been exploring the kitchen, checking several cabinets and other areas. The goal is to find and put 1 cutlery fork and 2 plates onto the kitchen table (72). She already found the cutlery fork, so that's one task done. Now she needs to find two plates.

Since Bob isn't holding anything, maybe he can help her by checking other areas. But wait, the problem says Alice is in the kitchen, and the livingroom, bedroom, bathroom are unexplored. So perhaps Bob could explore those areas for the plates? Or maybe they can check the kitchencabinets together.

Wait, the containers like kitchencabinet (75,76,79,80) are unchecked, so Alice might need to open them. But since she's in the kitchen and holding nothing, maybe Bob can help her with that by asking him to check those containers for plates.

In the message example, Alice asked Bob to check the fridge for juice, which he did. So here, Alice could ask Bob to check the kitchencabinets or other areas where plates might be found. Since the goal is to find two plates, she needs to find both.

I should make sure the message is helpful and brief, as per the note. So it should ask Bob for help in finding the plates. She can mention that she's already found the cutlery fork and perhaps suggest they work together on finding the plates next.
</think>

"Hey Bob, I found the cutlery fork! Let's find those two plates together.">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to help Alice send a message to Bob.

First, from what I understand, their goal is to find and put 1 cutlery fork and 2 plates onto the kitchen table (72). They've already found and placed both the cutlery fork (369) and one plate (373) on the table. So, they only need one more plate.

Alice is in the kitchen holding nothing. She's checked some containers but hasn't found anything else yet. Bob is also in the kitchen but isn't holding anything either.

Since Alice is looking around the kitchen and has already checked various kitchencabinets and other areas, she might need to check another place where a plate could be. Alternatively, maybe she needs to prompt Bob to look for the second plate elsewhere.

Looking at their previous actions, they've already gone through the bathroom and other areas but didn't find anything there. So perhaps Alice should suggest checking more containers in the kitchen or ask Bob to help search for the missing plate.

I think the message should be concise, asking Bob if he can check somewhere specific for the second plate or maybe offer to check together. It's important to keep it brief and clear so they can work efficiently.

Maybe Alice could say something like, "Hey Bob, I need one more plate. Can you check [somewhere] for it?" Since she's already checked some containers, perhaps there are specific places left, but without knowing the exact layout, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, in her progress, she mentioned checking <kitchencabinet> (79), (80), and also went to the stove and microwave. Maybe she should check the bathroomcabinet (190) or another area. But since she hasn't found anything there yet, maybe it's better to ask Bob to look somewhere else.

Alternatively, perhaps they can work together to check a specific spot that Alice hasn't checked yet.

I think the key is to keep it simple and helpful without adding extra info.
</think>

"Hey Bob, I need one more plate. Can you check the <bathroomcabinet> (190) or any other place I haven’t looked in the kitchen?">

Bob: <<think>
Okay, so Bob is trying to help Alice finish their housework by finding and putting two plates and one cutlery fork onto the kitchen table. Let me break down what's happening.

First, Bob is in the bedroom holding nothing. He found a plate (387) there and an unchecked container, which is the cabinet (328). So, he needs to figure out where to put these things or how to proceed next. The livingroom, kitchen, bathroom are all unexplored, so Alice might not be anywhere specific yet.

Looking at their dialogue history, both have promised to let each other know if they find goal objects or finish subgoals and ask for help when necessary. So, Bob needs to update Alice on his progress without being too wordy.

He found a plate in the bedroom. Since he's holding nothing, maybe he should mention that he can take more items if needed. The cabinet is unchecked, so perhaps he can open it and look inside. But since he's in the bedroom, he might need to move to another room to check the cabinet or find the cutlery fork.

Wait, does the container <cabinet> (328) mean there's something inside? Maybe the cutlery fork is inside that cabinet. If Bob can open it and take out the plate and then check the rest, he might need to coordinate with Alice on where to find the second plate or the cutlery.

Since Bob can hold two objects at a time, maybe after picking up the plate from the bedroom, he could also check the cabinet for more items. But without knowing what's inside, he needs to ask Alice if she's found anything in the kitchen, which is where the table is located.

So, the message should be concise: inform Alice of the plate found, mention the cabinet, and ask about her progress or the kitchen situation.
</think>

Hey Alice, I found a plate in the bedroom. There's an unchecked cabinet here, so I can check it for more items if needed. Are you checking the kitchen for anything?>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob: <<think>
Okay, so Bob is in the bedroom holding nothing except a plate he found there. He's also checking the cabinet but hasn't found anything yet. The goal is to get two plates and one cutlery fork onto the kitchen table. 

Hmm, maybe Bob should let Alice know what he has and ask for help with finding more items. Since they can both explore and hold objects, coordinating their efforts could be efficient.

He already sent a message before, so this time he might need to specify his current findings and request assistance in finding the remaining items or starting on the kitchen task.
</think>

Hey Alice, I'm holding nothing but found <plate> (387) in the bedroom. I also checked the <cabinet> (328). Do you know where the other plate and cutlery fork are? Let's figure this out together!>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what Bob should say next in this scenario. 

So, from the information given, Bob is in the bedroom holding nothing except maybe a plate he found there (387). He also found an unchecked container called <kitchenCabinet> (328), but it's not checked yet. His last message was about checking the stove and cabinets, so Alice has already explored the bathroom, living room, and bedroom.

The main goal is to get two plates and one cutlery fork onto the kitchen table. They've already found plate 387 on the kitchen table, so that's one down. Bob might need to find another plate or maybe check where the cutlery fork is.

Since Bob is in the bedroom now, he should probably ask Alice for directions on how to proceed. He could also offer to bring any items he finds over to the kitchen if needed. Maybe he can help her by checking other rooms she hasn't been to yet, like the living room or areas of the kitchen she hasn't explored fully.

He might say something like, "I'm in the bedroom, holding nothing. I found a plate here and checked the cabinet but found nothing. Should I check another room or focus on the kitchen? Let me know how you want to proceed."

That way, Alice can tell him where to go next or what to look for, helping them both work towards their goal efficiently.
</think>

"Hey Alice, I'm in the bedroom holding nothing. I found <plate> (387) here and checked the <kitchenCabinet> (328). Should I explore another room or focus on the kitchen? Let me know your plan.">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alice: <<think>
Okay, so Bob is in the bedroom checking things out and holding a plate he found there. He also saw a <kitchenCabinet> (328) that hasn't been checked yet. 

He needs to find another plate or objects but doesn't have any progress beyond what Alice has already achieved. Since Alice is in the kitchen and already placed one plate, maybe Bob can suggest they work together on finding the second plate or the cutlery fork.

Bob should probably inform Alice about his findings and ask for directions on how to proceed. Maybe he can ask if she needs help with anything else or suggest exploring other areas together.
</think>

"Hey Alice, I found a <plate> (387) in the bedroom and checked the <kitchenCabinet> (328), but it's empty. Should we work together to find the second plate or the cutlery fork?">
