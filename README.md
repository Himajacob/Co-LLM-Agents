## Appendix

### A. Planning Prompts

#### A.1 Base Prompt

**type:** base  
**prompt:**

Iâ€™m **`$AGENT_NAME$`**. Iâ€™m in a hurry to finish the housework with my friend **`$OPPO_NAME$`** together. Given our shared goal, dialogue history, and my progress and previous actions, please help me choose the best available action to achieve the goal as soon as possible.  
Note that I can hold two objects at a time and there are no costs for holding objects. All objects are denoted as `<name> (id)`, such as `<table> (712)`.

**Goal:** `$GOAL$`  
**Progress:** `$PROGRESS$`  

**Dialogue history:**  
Alice: "Hi, Iâ€™ll let you know if I find any goal objects and finish any subgoals, and ask for your help when necessary."  
Bob: "Thanks! Iâ€™ll let you know if I find any goal objects and finish any subgoals, and ask for your help when necessary."  
`$DIALOGUE_HISTORY$`  

**Previous actions:** `$ACTION_HISTORY$`  
**Available actions:**  
`$AVAILABLE_ACTIONS$`  

**Answer:**

#### A.2 Improved Base Prompt - Explicit Instructions

**type:** base  
**prompt:**

Iâ€™m **`$AGENT_NAME$`**. Iâ€™m in a hurry to finish the housework with my friend **`$OPPO_NAME$`** together. Given our shared goal, dialogue history, and my progress and previous actions, **you should select the most efficient action based on the goal, progress, and available options. Ensure your choice contributes directly to goal completion.**  
Note that I can hold two objects at a time and there are no costs for holding objects. All objects are denoted as `<name> (id)`, such as `<table> (712)`.

**Goal:** `$GOAL$`  
**Progress:** `$PROGRESS$`  
**Dialogue history:**  
Alice: "Hi, Iâ€™ll let you know if I find any goal objects and finish any subgoals, and ask for your help when necessary."  
Bob: "Thanks! Iâ€™ll let you know if I find any goal objects and finish any subgoals, and ask for your help when necessary."  
`$DIALOGUE_HISTORY$`  

**Previous actions:** `$ACTION_HISTORY$`  
**Available actions:**  
`$AVAILABLE_ACTIONS$`  

**Answer:**

#### A.3 Structured Base Prompt - Forced Reasoning

**type:** base  
**prompt:**

Iâ€™m **`$AGENT_NAME$`**. Iâ€™m in a hurry to finish the housework with my friend **`$OPPO_NAME$`** together. Given our shared goal, dialogue history, and my progress and previous actions, please help me choose the best available action to achieve the goal as soon as possible.  
Note that I can hold two objects at a time and there are no costs for holding objects. All objects are denoted as `<name> (id)`, such as `<table> (712)`.

**Goal:** `$GOAL$`  
**Progress:** `$PROGRESS$`  
**Dialogue history:**  
Alice: "Hi, Iâ€™ll let you know if I find any goal objects and finish any subgoals, and ask for your help when necessary."  
Bob: "Thanks! Iâ€™ll let you know if I find any goal objects and finish any subgoals, and ask for your help when necessary."  
`$DIALOGUE_HISTORY$`  

**Previous actions:** `$ACTION_HISTORY$`  
**Available actions:**  
`$AVAILABLE_ACTIONS$`  

**1. Analyze the goal:** What is the next step needed?  
**2. Analyze the progress:** What is my current state, and what do I still need to achieve the goal?  
**3. Evaluate actions:** Which action minimizes steps to reach the goal?

### B. Communication Prompts

#### B.1 Base Prompt

**type:** gen  
**prompt:**

Iâ€™m **`$AGENT_NAME$`**. Iâ€™m in a hurry to finish the housework with my friend **`$OPPO_NAME$`** together. Given our shared goal, dialogue history, and my progress and previous actions, please help me generate a short message to send to **`$OPPO_NAME$`** to help us achieve the goal as soon as possible.  
Note that I can hold two objects at a time and there are no costs for holding objects. All objects are denoted as `<name> (id)`, such as `<table> (712)`.

**Goal:** `$GOAL$`  
**Progress:** `$PROGRESS$`  
**Previous actions:** `$ACTION_HISTORY$`  
**Dialogue history:**  
Alice: "Hi, Iâ€™ll let you know if I find any goal objects and finish any subgoals, and ask for your help when necessary."  
Bob: "Thanks! Iâ€™ll let you know if I find any goal objects and finish any subgoals, and ask for your help when necessary."  
`$DIALOGUE_HISTORY$`  

**Note:** The generated message should be accurate, helpful and brief. Do not generate repetitive messages.

---

#### B.2 CPrompt1 - Instruction Removal

Same as B.1 with this added to the note:

**Note:** Respond as if you are directly speaking to **`$OPPO_NAME$`**. **DO NOT** include explanations, prefaces, or extra formatting and do not generate repetitive messages.

---

#### B.3 CPrompt2 - One Shot

Same as B.1 with this added at the end:

**Example:**  
Alice: "Hey Bob, I found an apple. Can you check the fridge for juice?"  
Bob: "Hey Alice, I checked the fridge. No juice here. Try the kitchen cabinet?"

---

#### B.4 CPrompt3 - Multi Shot

Same as B.1 with multi-turn example added:

**Example:**  
Alice: "Hey Bob, I found an apple. Can you check the fridge for juice?"  
Bob: "Hey Alice, I checked the fridge. No juice here. Try the kitchen cabinet?"  
Alice: "Hey Bob, I placed an apple on the table. Have you checked the cabinets?"  
Bob: "Hey Alice, I just checked the fridge. Iâ€™ll check the cabinets now."  
Alice: "Hey Bob, I found a cupcake in the kitchen. I have two objects on my hand, can you come and pick it up?"  
Bob: "Hey Alice, yes! I will come over and pick it up now."

---

#### B.5 CPrompt4 - CPrompt1 + CPrompt2

Combines direct instruction from CPrompt1 with the example from CPrompt2.

---

### C. Action Prompts

#### C.1 Base Prompt

**Answer with only one best next action. So the answer is**

---

#### C.2 Action Prompt 1 - One Shot

**Answer with only one best next action. Select the most efficient action and ensure your choice contributes directly to goal completion.**  
E.g. **E. [gocheck] `<cabinet>` (216)**, so the answer is
